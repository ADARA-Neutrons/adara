Prerequisites

EPICS (http://www.aps.anl.gov/epics/download/base/baseR3.14.12.2.tar.gz)

Boost (1.47 tested)
automake (1.11 tested)
autoconf (2.68 tested)


Building

1. Build EPICS (just extract and type make)
2. cd sms-repo
3. ./bootstrap (only need to do once)
4. ./configure --with-epics=/path/to/epics/
5. make (-jX)
6. Make /SNSlocal/sms writable by yourself (once)
7. Make /SNSlocal/sms/data, writable by yourself (once)
8. Copy the configuration in sms-repo to /SNSlocal/sms/conf (once)
9. Run as ./smsd

If you need to change the configuration (paths, ports, etc), edit smsd.cc and SMSControl.cc; a proper configuration system is on the the TODO list.

You can use caput, caget, and camonitor from EPICS to control recording.

PVs currently supported:
BL14BS:SMS:Recording
BL14BS:SMS:RunNumber
BL14BS:SMS:RunInfo:Reset
BL14BS:SMS:RunInfo:ProposalId
BL14BS:SMS:RunInfo:ProposalTitle
BL14BS:SMS:RunInfo:RunTitle
BL14BS:SMS:RunInfo:UserInfo
BL14BS:SMS:RunInfo:Sample:Id
BL14BS:SMS:RunInfo:Sample:Name
BL14BS:SMS:RunInfo:Sample:Nature
BL14BS:SMS:RunInfo:Sample:Formula
BL14BS:SMS:RunInfo:Sample:Environment


I've used BL14BS here as that matches the configuration files in the repo;
you can change the BL14BS in the PVs to be a string of your choosing by editing
the values given to the SMSControl constructor in smsd.cc.
