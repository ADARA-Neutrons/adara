   stc-jenkins     51417/udp               # stc-jenkins service


Service script in /etc/xinetd.d/stc-jenkins:

   # This is the configuration for the tcp/stream STC Jenkins Testing
   # service.

   service stc-jenkins
   {
       id              = stc-jenkins-stream
       wait            = no
       socket_type     = stream

       server          = /usr/local/sbin/stc-jenkins
       port            = 51417
   }


Server script in /usr/local/sbin/stc-jenkins:

   #!/bin/bash

   JENKINS_WORKSPACE="/SNSlocal/jenkins/workspace/ADARA_Software_Build"

   logfile="/var/log/ADARA/xinetd-stc-jenkins.log"
   ### Note! Don't put log file in $JENKINS_WORKSPACE, likely unwritable
   ### (for whatever goofy reason) and the script crashes... :-b

   touch $logfile
   date >> $logfile
   echo "Entry /usr/local/sbin/stc-jenkins." >> $logfile
   echo "Command Line Args: $*" >> $logfile

   ### Note! For Jenkins/Testing we set the STC Workspace to .../SNS/stcdata
   ### whereas for Production it needs to be Hard-Coded to a Specific Beamline
   ### (working directory needs to be set _Before_ BeamlineInfo available,
   ### but it's Ok wherever it is, as long as Same Filesystem as Archive
   ### for the final NeXus file "rename"... ;-D Whew!)

   echo "Running: $JENKINS_WORKSPACE/INSTALL/bin/stc -s -m -w /TESTING/JENKINS/SNS/stcdata -b /TESTING/JENKINS/" >> $logfile
   $JENKINS_WORKSPACE/INSTALL/bin/stc -s -m -w /TESTING/JENKINS/SNS/stcdata -b /TESTING/JENKINS/
   ### NOTE! *Don't* Redirect STC's stdout to the log file...! :-b
   ### The SMS needs to get that response...! :-D

   echo "After $JENKINS_WORKSPACE/INSTALL/bin/stc, return status = $?" >> $logfile

   echo "Exit /usr/local/sbin/stc-jenkins." >> $logfile
   date >> $logfile
